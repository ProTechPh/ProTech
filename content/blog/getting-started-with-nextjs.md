Next.js is a React framework that provides production-ready features out of the box. It handles routing, code splitting, and optimization automatically, allowing developers to focus on building great user experiences.

## Key Features of Next.js 14

### App Router

The App Router is the new default routing system in Next.js 14. It uses a file-system based routing approach, making it intuitive and easy to understand.

### Server Components

Server Components allow you to render components on the server, reducing the amount of JavaScript sent to the client and improving performance.

### Improved Performance

Next.js 14 includes numerous performance optimizations, including better code splitting, automatic image optimization, and enhanced caching strategies.

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

This will set up a new Next.js project with all the necessary configuration files and dependencies.

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 is an excellent choice for building modern web applications. Its combination of developer experience and performance makes it a top choice for many developers.
